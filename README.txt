MultithreadedServer implementation
================================================================================
The Multithreaded server starts a thread from an
ExecutorService.newCachedThreadPool() for each transaction. These threads read
the values they need and cache them for local access. The cache is implemented
as a TreeMap. At the end of a transaction the thread will attempt to aquire the
locks and then verify the values it read have not changed. If either of these
steps fail the thread will throw out the work it did and try again after a
random delay. The random delay is there to ensure that the thread can't
immediately aquire the locks it just released, giving other threads time to
operate with them. Once a thread aquires locks and verifies successfully it
will then write its changes to the master accounts list and display to the
console that it was successful.


================================================================================
Test Cases
================================================================================
We provide a series of test cases to simulate different interactions between the
threads.
